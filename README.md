# Module 8 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Overview

In this project, I used a combination of JavaScript, CSS and HTML in the order of most used to least used to design a weather forecast that displays the weather of a given city and their 5 day forecast. This requires OpenWeather API to generate the data needed for a city. I also used localStorage so that the user entries persist even after reloading the page.
